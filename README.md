# Hentai.js
Simple electron wrapper for rule34.xxx displaying your favourite hentai in a semi-slideshow format.

I started this dumb little project to learn the electron framework, so it's not the greatest thing ever. It's really simple and doesn't have many features but it taught me a lot so... that's cool.

# Installation
## Windows
Simply download the latest `setup.exe` release from the [[Releases]] tab and execute it, that will install the program and add it to your start menu. It is not signed so it may be detected by an antivirus.

While I do promise it's not a virus, you might still want to consider checking the source code or [[#Compiling from source]]
## MacOS
Simply download the latest `darwin` zip file from the [[Releases]] tab and execute the `hentaijs` executable. There is currently no better way to install the program.
## Arch Linux (AUR install)
If you use Arch Linux or an Arch-derived distribution, you can install `hentai.js` from the AUR. That package is maintained by myself so it will always be up to date.

Installing from the AUR will automatically disable update checking since your AUR helper will update the program automatically.
## Linux
Simply download the latest `linux` zip file from the [[Releases]] tab and execute the `hentaijs` executable. You might want to add it to your PATH or to your own Application Launcher for convenience.
